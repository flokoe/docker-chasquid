Note the certs/ directory matches certbot's structure, so if you use it you
can just symlink to /etc/letsencrypt/live.

You need at least one certificate, or the server will refuse to start.
Ideally there should be a certificate for each DNS name pointing to you.

Make sure the user you use to run chasquid under ("chasquid" in the example
systemd files) can access the certificates and private keys.


The user databases can be created and edited with the chasquid-util tool.
